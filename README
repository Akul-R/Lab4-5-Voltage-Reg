A voltage regulator made using an ATMega644PA and controlled by a host computer that communicates with the microcontroller using UART. Host software comes with a
sleek and responsive UI that is fairly simple to use.
The PWM output is connected to an LPF (R = 100k, C = 220nF) and varying the duty cycle of the PWM wave allows you to vary the output voltage.
